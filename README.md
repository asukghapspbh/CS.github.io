    <section>
        <p>High-frequency trading (HFT) is an advanced algorithm and using the latest technology to make trades quickly. HFT strategies are used to take small price differences, market imbalances, and short-term trends to make a profit in a short time.</p>
        <p>This part of this project is going to analyze Key Algorithms and Strategies in High-Frequency Trading, such as statistical arbitrage, market making, momentum ignition, and Other Strategies.</p>
        
        <h2>A. Statistical Arbitrage</h2>
        <p>Statistical Arbitrage is a statistical trading model that uses price differences between related financial instruments to make trade decision. The main objective is to find groups of assets that change the price together and make profit by changing their price relationship.</p>
        <p>Cointegration Algorithms finds long-term relationships between groups of assets...</p>
        
        <h2>B. Market Making</h2>
        <p>Market making is a strategy where traders offering buy (bid) and sell (ask) prices continuously for a financial instrument...</p>

        <h2>C. Momentum Ignition</h2>
        <p>Momentum ignition is a HFT strategy that involves a series of trades to create or amplify price trends...</p>

        <h2>D. Other Strategies</h2>
        <p>Latency arbitrage takes advantage of differences in how fast market participants receive and process information...</p>
